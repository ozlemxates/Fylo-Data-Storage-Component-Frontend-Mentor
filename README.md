### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

In this project, my goal was to take my previously learned and practiced CSS and HTML skills to the next level. I aimed to create code that is cleaner and more understandable, striving for a more consistent and maintainable coding style when building the project. So, I tried to  make as effective as possible use of CSS selectors, classes, and IDs to target specific elements and apply styles consistently. And for HTML, I focused on creating well-structured and semantically meaningful markup. 

###### Key Objectives
- Enhancing CSS and HTML skills
- Writing clean and understandable code
- Striving for optimal solutions and approaches
- Improving code readability and maintainability
